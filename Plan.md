Parallel Thumbnail Generation and Duplicate Filter
Generate image thumbnails for large photo collections in parallel.

Use hashing or pixel comparison to detect and filter duplicate thumbnails.

Real-world use: Photo gallery management, web image optimization.

Parallelism: Thumbnail creation and hashing per image is embarrassingly parallel.
